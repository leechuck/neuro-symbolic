# Neuro-Symbolic AI Course Slides

This repository contains the LaTeX source code for the "Neuro-Symbolic AI" course slides.

## Course Overview

This course covers various topics at the intersection of neural networks and symbolic artificial intelligence, including:
- Logic Tensor Networks (LTN)
- Logical Neural Networks (LNN)
- Deep Learning & Embeddings
- Neural Answer Set Programming (ASP)
- Inductive Logic Programming (ILP)

## Repository Structure

The slides are organized as individual LaTeX files using the Beamer class:

- `01-introduction.tex`: Course Introduction
- `02-ltn.tex`: Logic Tensor Networks
- `03-lnn.tex`: Logical Neural Networks
- `04-dl.tex`: Deep Learning
- `05-dl-embedding-1.tex`: Embeddings (Part 1)
- `06-neural-asp.tex`: Neural ASP
- `07-ilp.tex`: Inductive Logic Programming

## Build Instructions

### Prerequisites
You need a standard LaTeX distribution (like TeX Live) installed on your system.

### Compiling Slides
To generate the PDF for a specific lecture, run `pdflatex`:

```bash
pdflatex 01-introduction.tex
```

You may need to run the command multiple times to ensure all references and navigation elements are correctly generated.

### Cleaning Up
To remove intermediate auxiliary files generated by LaTeX:

```bash
rm *.aux *.log *.nav *.out *.snm *.toc *.vrb
```

## Contributing
Please follow the existing style conventions (Madrid theme) when making changes. Refer to `AGENTS.md` for detailed development guidelines.
