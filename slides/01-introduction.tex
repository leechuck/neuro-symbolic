  \frametitle{What is a viable research question?}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item qualitative (proof) vs quantitative (experiment)
  \item usually: improve method $X$ to address limitation $Y$
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $X$ --- existing method to solve some problem
    \item $Y$ --- how to find?
      \begin{itemize}
      \item analysis (primary research!)
      \item theoretical argument
      \item literature (check Discussion for limitations)
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \item or: develop method $X$ to overcome limitation $Y$ in methods
    addressing problem $Z$
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Examples}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Can we develop an algorithm with $O(n \cdot \log{n})$ runtime
    that sorts a list of integers accurately in descending order?
    \pause
  \item Can graph neural networks improve reasoning over first order
    theories?
    \pause
    \begin{itemize}
    \item These are not good research question on their own!
    \item How are current methods limited?
    \item How could GNNs overcome this limitation?
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Not: ``Apply X to Y'' but ``X can solve limitation Z in
        algorithms for Y''
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Answering the question}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item baseline
    \begin{itemize}
    \item how does method $X'$ solve problem $P$ now?
    \item quantify, and justify: which measure is appropriate? which
      test case / dataset is appropriate?
    \item are there different {\bf types} of methods to solve $P$? Did
      you include a representative for each?
    \item Why did you include method $X'$ over $X''$?
    \end{itemize}
    \pause
  \item workflow $W$: build a skeleton method to solve problem $P$
    \begin{itemize}
    \item can you reuse existing code? Check Github...
    \item you need to get from input (your dataset) to output (a
      number --- quantify!)
    \end{itemize}
    \pause
  \item actual methods research
    \begin{itemize}
    \item add your idea to $W$ and quantify --- do performance metrics
      improve?
    \item one idea at a time, quantify, iterate
    \item tune, optimize (usually not part of the RQ)
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Considerations}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item feasibility: workplan/idea adequate to answer the question?
  \item novel: did somebody try before? How is your work different
    from others?
    \begin{itemize}
    \item find limitation in state of the art --- from experience,
      papers, etc.
    \item know novel, emerging methods deeply --- know their
      limitations, which problems they can solve and how
    \item then: apply novel method to problem to overcome limitation
    \end{itemize}
    \pause
  \item interesting and relevant: will people care? Can you explain
    why its relevant, important? For whom? Can others build on your
    results, use your method?
    \begin{itemize}
    \item impact
    \item problem statement
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

  \item clear description of problem to be solved (10\%)
  \item description and analysis of state of the art (10\%)
    \begin{itemize}
    \item how is the state of the art limited?
    \end{itemize}
  \item method to overcome limitation of the state of the art (20\%)
    \begin{itemize}
    \item must combine neural/statistical and symbolic methods!
    \end{itemize}
  \item experiments or proof (10\%)
  \item manuscript, report, paper (10\%)
    \begin{itemize}

% Motivation
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Motivation}

\item Growing interest in combining Machine Learning with Knowledge
  Representation

\item Fueled by recent keynotes and workshops in the field
\end{itemize}

  \frametitle{What is Artificial Intelligence?}
  \begin{quote}
    Why is there so much excitement about neural networks today, and
    how is this related to research in AI? Much has been said, in
    the popular press [...]
  \end{quote}

  (Marvin Minsky, 1991)

  \begin{block}{Symbolic AI (GOFAI)}
    A physical symbol system takes physical patterns (symbols),
    combines them into structures (expressions) and manipulates them
    (using processes) to produce new expressions.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

% Two Families of Techniques
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Two Families of Techniques}
\begin{itemize}
\item Learning Methods: Predominantly statistical
\item Reasoning Methods: Predominantly discrete
\item General conclusion: Human-level AI requires symbiotic
  collaboration of data and models
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Why symbols?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Symbols are physical entities that can encode for our {\em
    knowledge} of the world (e.g., for a proposition $P$)
\item We want knowledge to affect our decisions:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item do A if world believed to satisfy P
  \end{itemize}
\item $P$ may not be {\em explicitly} represented $\Rightarrow$ need
  symbol manipulation and search
\item Example:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Patient $x$ is allergic to medication $m$: $all(x,m)$
  \item Anybody allergic to $m$ is also allergic to $m'$: $\forall
    y(all(y,m) \rightarrow all(y,m'))$
  \item It's not safe to prescribe medication if allergic: $\forall a,
    b (all(a,b) \rightarrow \neg safe(a,b))$
  \item Is it safe to prescribe $m'$ to $x$: $safe(x, m')$ ?
  \end{itemize}
\item symbol systems: formal logic, arithmetic, algebra, term/graph
  rewriting systems, digital computer
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Physical Symbol System Hypothesis}
  \begin{quote}
    A physical symbol system has
    the necessary and sufficient means for general intelligent
    action. [Newell \& Simon, 1976]
  \end{quote}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Limitations}
  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=.75\textwidth]{chinese-room.png}}  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item symbol grounding (hard to learn from data)
  \item very inflexible (inconsistencies, mathematical proofs)
  \item yet: sound and complete
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Connectionist systems}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item parallel distributed processing units, neural networks
  \item biologically inspired
  \item non-symbolic, sub-symbolic
    \begin{itemize}
    \item learn from data
    \end{itemize}
  \item challenges:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item interpretability
    \item compositionality
    \end{itemize}
  \item Research question: how much of intelligent behavior is
    symbolic?
  \item Research theme: how to combine symbolic and connectionist
    systems to overcome their individual limitations?
  \end{itemize}
